# Data Structures and Algorithms

This repository contains problems I've outlined and solved, and ones which I find both useful and crucial to understanding data structures and algorithms. This repository is composed of the following three main directories:

+ Algorithms and Problems
+ Data Structures
+ Recursion

Each directory has many nested sub-directories that hold relevant sub-topics. 


## Study Them, Know Them, Love Them

Seriously. Want to ace your interviews? Want to solve problems and bugs faster? Want to develop cleaner, better
designed applications?

**Then study this shit.**
